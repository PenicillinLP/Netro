Netro is born in the iGEM competetion in 2017, as part of the project of team Fudan. 

The home page of Netro is: http://2017.igem.org/Team:Fudan/Software. A video tutorial is also available here.

You can also explore our iGEM project at: http://2017.igem.org/Team:Fudan.

Netro itself is designed to help you design and explore your own gene transcription network, while Netro_Fudan is a demonstration on our iGEM project. This is a web software based on Javascript, and designed for everyone. You can easily play with it witout any knowledge about programming.

A software can never be perfect even after thousands of tests. We tried to protect Netro from all kinds of errors and illegal operations, but bugs could appear where we have never beening searching before. We will appreciate any kind of feedback or even improvement from you.
